ZXC1 is an OoO procesor implementing my custom MX-CISC ISA, its target clock speed when synthesized for the Cyclone IV FPGA (Likely for the DE0 Nano) is 80-100MHz, idealy 95+

The MX-CISC ISA is a custom CISC ISA where instructions range from 2 Bytes to 12 Bytes and it is still being expanded upon to include more features and extensions.
